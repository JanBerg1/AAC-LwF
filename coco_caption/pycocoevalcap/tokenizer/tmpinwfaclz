a baby is laughing and the mother is playing with her baby
wind is blowing and ocean waves are crashing and water is splashing and a person once in the background
music is ongoing while water gurgles and splashes and a bird chirps and sings
water splashing with male speech
a loud whistling sound is in the background followed by a series of loud bird screeches
wind blows strongly
as a baby talks in the distance a woman speaks nearby
a series of vehicle beep and clanks are followed by low voices communicating in the background
rustling with distant murmuring
the loud regular clack of typing ensues followed by paper being pulled
squeaking nearby with distant chirps of birds and nearby rustling
some motorcycle moves then a horn is and motorcycles are accelerates and a man shouts
people clap and speak in the distance
people talk quietly in the distance followed by a police car siren wailing
water trickles as a small engine is revving up
a man speaking in the background with another man talking followed by a rooster crowing and light wind blowing in a microphone
many voices yelling then applause
a woman speaking with distant croaks and chirps of frogs then a child speaks
a man talking clicking of jars
water pours and then splashes nearby
a man talks as something metal hits against and glass is set down
white noise and screaming
a toy engine whirring louder and louder
sirens ring and approach with humming of distant traffic
children cry and people talk
humming and rattling of an engine idling as it revs
a toilet flushing followed by shuffling and a woman speaking in the background with some camera
a toy helicopter flying followed by a kid talking
a ringing of a bell with constant ticking of a clock and some vibrations
constant static as a clock plays a tune and then a man says something and laughs
vehicle engine revving
music plays then a man speaks before multiple noises collide
an infant crying as a woman laughs
a man speaking as water trickles while a small motor hums
